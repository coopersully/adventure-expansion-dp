# About the project
**Curse's RPG Loot is a spigot plugin/datapack duo that aims to change up the survival experience by adding roleplay-themed weapons, armor, and mobs to the game.**
It modifies loot pools of the generic Minecraft experience to better immerse the player in an open world, roleplay-ready environment. **By installing the plugin, it
will automatically install all necessary dependencies & datapacks for the project to work properly, making the setup as easy as drag & drop.** There are several changesand additions to the loot found in structures throughout all worlds, as well as a few new variations of mobs to encounter along the way.

## Treasure Items
The project adds several new items and item variants that players can find via exploration; these items are labeled **Treasure Items** and can be identified by their uniquely colored names, item descriptions, and **Statistics** tabs. Each treasure item has its own rarity value, indiciating how commonly it appears in the natural world; the rarities in this project are an adaptation of Minecraft's own color-based rarities (with a few additions) and are as follows:
### General Item Rarities
#### âšª Common Treasure Item (White, &f)
- This type of item has the highest probability of dropping and is therefore the most common.
- These items never have abilities.
#### ðŸŸ¢ Uncommon Treasure Item (Yellow, &e)
- This type of item has the second highest probability of dropping.
- These items usually have little to no abilities.
#### ðŸ”µ Rare Treasure Item (Aqua, &b)
- This type of item has a medium probability of dropping.
- Although not common, these items sometimes have unique abilities.
#### ðŸŸ£ Epic Treasure Item (Light Purple, &d)
- This type of item has the second lowest probability of dropping.
- These items will regularly have unique abilities.
#### ðŸ”´ Mythical Treasure Item (Red, &c)
- This type of item has the lowest probability of dropping and is therefore the least common.
- These items almost always have unique and strong abilities.
#### âš« Dark Rarity (Dark Gray, &7)
- This type of item does not naturally generate in the world and can only be accessed via commands).
- These items almost always have unique and strong abilities.

It may be of use to note that similar to vanilla Minecraft, the project also includes seperate "cosmetic-rarity" categories that in no way determine the item's power level; these are merely for decoration or categorical significance and are usually found via special quests, trades, or mobs.
