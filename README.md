# Curse's RP Addon for Minecraft 1.18+
Curse's RP Addon is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to change up the survival experience by adding roleplay-themed items, blocks, and mobs to the game. It modifies the loot pools of mobs in the game to better immerse the player in an open world, roleplay-ready environment. There are several changes and additions to the loot found in structures throughout all worlds, as well as a few new variations of mobs to encounter along the way.

## Treasure Items
This datapack adds several new items and item variants that players can find via exploration; these items are labeled "Treasure Items" and can be identified by their unique names, appearances, and "Statistics" tabs in their descriptions. With each treasure item, the color of the item's name determines it's rarity (and usu. it's power-level); the rarities in this datapack are an adaptation of Minecraft's own color-based rarities and are as follows:
### Item Rarities
1. Common Treasure Item (White, Non-Colored, &f)
	- This item has the highest probability of dropping and is therefore the most common (300 weight).
	- These items never have abilities.
2. Uncommon Treasure Item (Yellow, &e)
	- This item has the second highest probability of dropping (150 weight).
	- These items usually have little to no abilities.
3. Rare Treasure Item (Aqua, &b)
	- This item has a medium probability of dropping (50 weight).
	- Although not common, these items sometimes have unique abilities.
4. Epic Treasure Item (Light Purple, &d)
	- This item has the second lowest probability of dropping (10 weight).
	- These items will regularly have unique abilities.
5. Mythical Treasure Item (Red, &c)
	- This item has the lowest probability of dropping and is therefore the least common (1 weight).
	- These items almost always have unique and strong abilities.
### Miscellanious Rarities
The datapack, similar to vanilla Minecraft, also includes seperate rarity categories that in no way determine the item's power level but are merely for decoration or categorical significance.
	- Ominous Treasure Item (Orange, &6, Pillagers Only)
